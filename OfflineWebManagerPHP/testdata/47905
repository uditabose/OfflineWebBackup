'''Kolkata''' {{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|k|ɑː|t|ɑː}}, also known historically in English as '''Calcutta''' {{IPAc-en|k|ae|l|'|k|V|t|@}}, is the [[Capital city|capital]] of the Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. Located on the east bank of the [[Hooghly river]], it is the principal commercial, cultural, and educational centre of [[East India]], while the [[Port of Kolkata]] is India's oldest operating port as well as its sole major riverine port. As of 2011, the city had 4.5&nbsp;million residents; the urban agglomeration, which comprises the city and its suburbs, was home to approximately 14.1&nbsp;million, making it the [[List of most populous metropolitan areas in India|third-most populous metropolitan area]] in India. As of 2008, its economic output as measured by gross domestic product [[List of cities by GDP|ranked third]] among South Asian cities, behind [[Mumbai]] and [[Delhi]].<ref name="pricewater">{{cite web|url=https://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/imagelibrary/downloadMedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=1562|title=Global city GDP rankings 2008–2025|publisher=Pricewaterhouse Coopers|date= November 2009 |pages=31–32|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref> As a growing metropolitan city in a developing country, Kolkata confronts substantial urban pollution, traffic congestion, poverty, overpopulation, and other logistic and socioeconomic problems.

In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Kolkata were ruled by the [[Nawab of Bengal]] under [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] [[suzerainty]]. After the Nawab granted the [[East India Company]] a trading license in 1690,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dutta|first=K.|last2=Desai|first2=A.|date=April 2008|title=Calcutta: a cultural history|publisher=Interlink Books|location=Northampton, Massachusetts, US|pages=9–10|isbn=978-1-56656-721-3|ref=harv|postscript=.}}</ref> the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified mercantile base. Nawab [[Siraj ud-Daulah]] occupied Kolkata in 1756 after company started evading taxes and due to increasing militarization of the fort, the East India Company retook it in the following year and in 1793 assumed full sovereignty after Mughal governorship (Nizamat) was abolished. Under East India Company and later under the [[British Raj]], Kolkata served as the capital of India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in [[Bengal]], led to a shift of the capital to [[New Delhi]]. The city was the centre of the [[Indian independence movement]]; it remains a hotbed of [[Politics of West Bengal|contemporary state politics]]. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata—which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics—witnessed several decades of relative economic stagnation. Since the early 2000s, an economic rejuvenation has led to accelerated growth.

As a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th-century [[Bengal Renaissance]] and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in Bengal and India, Kolkata has established local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature that have gained wide audiences. Many [[List of people from Kolkata|people from Kolkata]]—among them several Nobel laureates—have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas, while [[Kolkata culture]] features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively [[Para (Bengali)|close-knit neighbourhoods]] (''paras'') and [[Adda (South Asian)|freestyle intellectual exchanges]] (''adda''). West Bengal's share of the [[Cinema of Bengal|Bengali film industry]] is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta|Academy of Fine Arts]], the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]], the [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]], the [[Indian Museum]], and the [[National Library of India]]. Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities [[Football in Kolkata|by giving importance]] to [[association football]] and other sports.

==Etymology==

The word ''Kolkata'' derives from the Bengali term ''[[Kalikata|Kôlikata]]'' ({{Lang-bn|কলিকাতা}}) [ˈkɔlikat̪a], the name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British, in the area where the city eventually was to be established; the other two villages were [[Sutanuti]] and [[Gobindapur, Kolkata|Govindapur]].<ref name=spatialchange>{{cite book |title= Globalizing cities: a new spatial order?|last=Chakravorty|first=Sanjoy|editor1-last=Marcuse |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Kempen |editor2-first=Ronald van |chapter=From colonial city to global city?

There are several explanations about the etymology of this name: 
* The term ''Kolikata'' is thought to be a variation of ''Kalikkhetrô'' [ˈkalikʰːet̪rɔ] ({{Lang-bn|কালীক্ষেত্র}}), meaning "Field of [the goddess] [[Kali]]". 
* Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term ''kilkila'' ({{lang-bn|কিলকিলা}}), or "flat area".<ref name=chatterjeename>{{cite book |title= Water resources, conservation and management|last=Chatterjee |first=S.N. |year= 2008|publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-269-0868-4 |page=85 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lpREeIZQvrcC |accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> 
* The name may have its origin in the words ''khal'' [ˈkʰal] ({{lang-bn|খাল}}) meaning "canal", followed by ''kaṭa'' [ˈkata] ({{lang-bn|কাটা}}), which may mean "dug".<ref name=Nair>{{Cite book
|last = Nair|first=P. Thankappan |title = Calcutta in the 17th century |pages=54–58|publisher = Firma KLM |location=Kolkata|year = 1986}}</ref> 
* According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] or ''koli chun'' [ˈkɔlitɕun] ({{lang-bn|কলি চুন}}) and coir or ''kata'' [ˈkat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কাতা}}); hence, it was called ''Kolikata'' [ˈkɔlikat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কলিকাতা}}).<ref name=chatterjeename/>

While the city's name has always been pronounced ''Kolkata'' [ˈkolkat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কলকাতা}}) or ''Kôlikata'' [ˈkɔlikat̪a] ({{lang-bn|কলিকাতা}}) in Bengali, the anglicised form ''Calcutta'' was the official name until 2001, when it [[Renaming of cities in India|was changed]] to ''Kolkata'' in order to match Bengali pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/papers/india.html |title= The politics of name changes in India|accessdate=26 January 2012|last=Easwaran|first= Kenny|publisher=Open Computing Facility, University of California at Berkeley
